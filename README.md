# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Mohamad Nawal Taufiqurohman, S.T

I'm an **AI-Assisted Technologist** â€” I design real-world tech solutions using AI like ChatGPT to assist in planning, coding, and deploying projects, especially in IoT and applied technologies.

## ðŸš€ My Focus
- IoT (Arduino, ESP32)
- Integrations (Google Sheets, Firebase, Web Server, Modbus, Blynk)
- AI-assisted development workflows
- Applied technology in agriculture

## ðŸŒ± Mission
Building a strong personal portfolio by documenting AI-supported projects.  
Bridging ideas and execution without being a traditional programmer.

ðŸ”§ Tools: Arduino IDE, Office Suites, Firebase, Blynk, ChatGPT  
ðŸŽ¯ Goal: Turning AI-assisted projects into a monetizable portfolio in 1â€“2 years

> Not a coder â€” but a thinker, system designer, and maker with AI as my right hand.
